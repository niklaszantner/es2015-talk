# Next Generation JavaScript with ES 2015

Code samples from the talk "Next Generation JavaScript with ES 2015" at [ONE LOGIC](http://onelogic.de/en).

## Try it out

Run `npm install` to install babel and the 'es2015' preset. Then you can call `babel <file>` to transpile individual file to ES5 or `babel-node <file>` to execute the file. Many of the files contain ES5 as well as ES2015 code. Make sure to comment out the ES5 code to prevent errors because of duplicate definitions.

## Credits

The code samples are largely inspired by [Axel Rauschmayer](rauschma.de) and [Babel](http://babeljs.io/docs/learn-es2015/)
